<!-- Game of War
Have you played the card game War? It's very simple!

Two players evenly split a shuffled deck of 52 standard playing cards. Each stack is facedown, and players cannot look at the cards in their stack or rearrange them. The objective of the game is to play until one player has all 52 cards in their stack.

Players take turns playing the top card from their stacks. Whoever's card is a higher value puts both cards at the bottom of their stack.

If there is a tie, then it's War! Each player adds three cards of their stack face down. Each player reveals their fourth card. Whoever wins that reveal takes all of the cards! If there is another tie the process repeats until there is a winner.

Instructions
Create a new repository on GitHub (not GitHub Enterprise).
Clone down the repository and complete your work in there.
Fulfill the listed requirements below.
Please turn in your submission by the deadline on your cohort calendar. Submit your project by posting an issue on this repository with a link to your repository on GitHub (not GitHub Enterprise).

Technical Requirements
Your project should meet the following requirements:

Your game should run without errors
The game starts immediately when the JavaScript is executed. Create your two players and start the rounds!
There is no user input. The program simply loops through rounds until the game is finished.
Print a message for each round showing the cards played by each user, who won the round, and how many cards each player has.
Include a README written in well-formatted Markdown (hint: look up README templates)
Show a good commit history with frequent commits (We're looking for lots of small commits!)
Hints
Adding a property for the "value" of a rank could make it easier to compare face cards (ie: Jack < Queen). For example, 2-10 will represent each number and then 11, 12, 13, 14 for J Q K A, respectively.
It could be helpful to have a class to represent the overall Game, particularly when handling ties and other complicated game states.
Write Pseudocode!
Break the project down into different components. What are the pieces to this problem? Solve them each individually and build towards a solution for the overall problem. Teach each piece individually before moving on!
Make it work, make it good, make it fast. This is a common developer axiom. It means: focus first on making something work (even if it isn't well written or it's buggy). Then, turn to making it work well. Then, and only then, start to worry about other things like performance. -->
